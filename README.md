Great_Glass_Teleporter
======================

Builds a teleporter and sends Steve around the Minecraft world

Is it possiable to remove the first Teleporter once the Player has moved to a new location?

Once the teleporting code was operational I considered building a teleporter within the game, this started off as blue blocks, then I wanted to place the player inside the device.  This was achieved by working out the x, y and z position of the middle of the teleporter, (can I call it a TARDIS from now on!), then sending the player to that position to place them inside the TARDIS.  But, with blue blocks it was too dark inside and you could not see anything, so I changed the blocks of the TARDIS to glass, hey presto a 'great glass elevator'.  The next stage was to introduce a function to allow the player to teleport around the world by selecting their desired x, y and z location.  Once selected and entered, Steve was teleported to that location arriving in the in the TARDIS / elevator thingy machine.
